#------- INSERT YOUR CODE HERE for main -------
#
#  Best is to convert the C program line by line
#    into its assembly equivalent.  Carefully review
#    the coding templates near the end of Lecture 8.
#
#
#  1.  First, read m (the matrices will then be size mxm).
li $v0, 5
syscall

move $t0, $v0

li $t1, 11
slt $s0, $t0, $t1
beq $s0, $0, returnZero


#  2.  Next, read matrix A followed by matrix B.
li, $t2, 0
loop:
  beq $t2, $t0, endloop
#  3.  Compute matrix product.  You will need triple-nested loops for this.
#  4.  Print the result, one row per line, with one (or more) space(s) between
#      values within a row.
#  5.  Exit.
#
#------------ END CODE ---------------


exit:                     # this is code to terminate the program -- don't mess with this!
  addi $v0, $0, 10      	# system call code 10 for exit
  syscall               	# exit the program



#------- If you decide to make other functions, place their code here -------
#
#  You do not have to use helper methods, but you may if you would like to.
#  If you do use them, be sure to do all the proper stack management.
#  For this exercise though, it is easy enough to write all your code
#  within main.

#------------ END CODE ---------------
